    <h2>Bryson Hiskey</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Bryson Hiskey and I am currently in the Cybersecurity major here at BYU-Idaho! I am loving it so far. Some things I love to do are hanging out with my wife, playing board games, some video games, hiking, hunting, fishing camping, and also just chilling around and watching some good Tv shows and movies. <p>
        <p>I just got married about a month ago and it has been the best thing ever! I currently work for Hobby Lobby but I am trying to find a Tech job asap to build experience. I love BYU-Idaho because of the very hands on environment and all of the professors help and want us to succeed. I see lots of advantages taking this class, for me the best part will be learning about CSS and HTML more which will be very beneficial and I hear we do a lot of that in this class! I have been a member of the church all my life and got back from my mission in Copenhagen Denmark almost 2 years ago!</p></p>
